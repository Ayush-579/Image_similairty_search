📸 Google Lens Alternative – Image Similarity Search
🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to develop an alternative to Google Lens by implementing image similarity search using multiple approaches. The solution leverages different neural network architectures to extract embeddings and perform similarity searches, comparing their performance using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.

Approaches Implemented:

* Autoencoder
* ResNet50 (Pretrained)
* VGG16 (Pretrained)
* Vision Transformer (ViT, Pretrained)


📊 Key Objectives
- Propose 4-5 methods for performing image similarity searches.
- Fine-tune the FashionMNIST dataset for each model.
- Evaluate and compare models using precision, recall, F1-score, and LRAP (Label Ranking Average Precision).
- Prioritize computational efficiency for real-time performance.

- Python
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- scikit-learn
- Numpy
