📌 Image Similarity Search – Google Lens Alternative
This project aims to build an image similarity search engine as an alternative to Google Lens. It leverages multiple deep learning approaches such as autoencoders, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The goal is to implement, fine-tune, and evaluate these models on an image dataset to perform image retrieval based on similarity.

🚀 Project Overview
Objective:
Implement image similarity search using different neural network architectures.
Fine-tune models with image datasets for better retrieval accuracy.
Evaluate performance metrics such as precision, recall, and retrieval accuracy across models.
Optimize computational efficiency for real-time image search.
✨ Key Deliverables:
GitHub Repository – Structured with code, datasets, and models.
Documentation – Clear explanation of methods, usage, and dataset preparation.
Models – Trained models (Autoencoder, ResNet50, VGG16, ViT) with .pth weights.
Comparative Analysis – Evaluate and report performance metrics.
Video Explanation – Walkthrough of code, model architecture, and outputs.

📊 Methodologies and Approaches
Autoencoder:
Encoder-decoder architecture to map input images to latent space.
Useful for unsupervised feature extraction.
CNN-Based Models (ResNet50, VGG16):
ResNet50 – Uses residual connections to tackle vanishing gradient issues.
VGG16 – A simple yet effective deep CNN architecture.
Vision Transformer (ViT):
Uses transformer blocks instead of convolution, focusing on attention mechanisms.
Achieves state-of-the-art performance in image classification and retrieval.
🔧 Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Ayush-579/Image_similarity_search.git
cd Image_similarity_search
2. Install Required Packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Dataset Preparation:
Place image datasets in the data/ directory.
Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and resized to fit model input dimensions.
4. Running the Project:
To perform image similarity search:

bash
Copy code
python __main__.py
�� Model Training and Fine-Tuning
Modify scripts in src/ to train models on custom datasets.
Example (ResNet50):
bash
Copy code
python src/Resnet50.py --train --data data/
📈 Evaluation and Metrics
The following metrics are used to evaluate performance:

Precision & Recall – Measure relevance of retrieved images.
Retrieval Accuracy – Number of correct matches in the top K results.
Computational Efficiency – Time taken for image similarity retrieval.
⚙️ Model Comparison
Model	Precision	Recall	Retrieval Accuracy	Latency (ms)
Autoencoder	85%	78%	80%	45

📝 Notes:
Large models (*.pth) are tracked using Git LFS to avoid exceeding quota.
Ensure .gitignore prevents unnecessary files from being pushed.
